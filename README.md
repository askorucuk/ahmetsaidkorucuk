## 🌟 Overview

The website serves as a landing page showcasing a dynamic 3D scene consisting of thousands of particles forming a galaxy structure. The scene includes animations such as:
- Continuous rotation of the galaxy.
- Periodic "explosion" effects where particles temporarily expand and change color.
- Interactive camera controls allowing users to zoom and rotate around the scene.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: semantic structure for the layout (Header, Footer).
- **CSS3**: Styling with a focus on full-screen layout, gradients, and backdrop filters for a modern aesthetic.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core logic for the application.
- **Three.js**: 3D library used for rendering the particle system, lighting, and camera controls.

## ✨ Features

- **3D Particle System**: A procedurally generated galaxy with custom colors and distribution parameters.
- **Interactivity**: 
  - `OrbitControls` allow users to rotate and zoom around the galaxy.
  - Hover effects on social media icons in the footer.
- **Responsive Design**: The canvas and UI elements resize dynamically to fit the window dimensions.
